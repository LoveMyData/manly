Manly Council scraper

This site was a bit tricky to get the data out

We have Terms need to agreed and then keep track the cookie and deal with JavaScript, finally the actual description of the DA is store on another page. Wow....

By default: it will look for 'thisweek' of DAs, for data recovery you can set the MORPH_PERIOD=thismonth or MORPH_PERIOD=lastmonth

It is now done and enjoy!!
