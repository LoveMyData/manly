Manly Council scraper
---------------------

This site was a bit tricky to get the data out.

There are Terms that need to be agreed to, a cookie to be tracked, and JavaScript to deal with. Finally the actual description of the DA is stored on another page. Wow....

By default: it will look for 'thisweek' of DAs, for data recovery you can set the MORPH_PERIOD=thismonth or MORPH_PERIOD=lastmonth.

It is now done and enjoy!!
